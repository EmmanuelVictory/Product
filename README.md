# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! This is my solution to the Product Preview Card challenge from Frontend Mentor. I built this project to practice turning a design into a functional, responsive component using only HTML and CSS.

# About the Challenge

Frontend Mentor challenges are amazing for sharpening real-world frontend skills. This particular challenge provided a design for a premium-looking product card. The goal was to replicate it as closely as possible â€” matching layout, colors, typography, and interactive states.

# My Approach

I started with a clean HTML structure, then applied CSS for layout and styling.
â€¢ The project uses semantic HTML for better readability.
â€¢ The card layout was achieved with simple positioning techniques.
â€¢ I used the provided color palette to keep everything consistent with the design.
â€¢ A responsive layout will be my next improvement â€” this version is desktop-focused.

# What I Learned

    â€¢	Translating a design into code takes careful attention to spacing, font sizes, and alignment.
    â€¢	Small UI components can teach a lot about hierarchy, balance, and accessibility.
    â€¢	Even simple challenges can reveal ways to write cleaner, more maintainable CSS.

# Tools Used

    â€¢	HTML5
    â€¢	CSS3

No frameworks â€” just pure, clean code.
